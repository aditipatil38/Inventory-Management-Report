<h3 align="center"> Section 1: Inventory Performance Overview </h3>
<p>This section provides a holistic view of how inventory is performing across time, categories, and regions. It focuses on the health of stock levels, utilization efficiency, and how effectively inventory is turning over.</p>

- `Current Inventory Status`: A snapshot of available stock across locations, highlighting what’s on hand and what's at risk of stockouts.
- `Monthly Inventory Value Trend`: Tracks how the total value of inventory is changing over time, helping identify cost patterns or overstocking.
- `Inventory Utilization Over Time`: Measures how efficiently inventory is being consumed relative to what's available, signaling performance and waste.
- `Inventory Turnover by Product Category`: Analyzes how often stock is sold and replaced, broken down by category to pinpoint fast- and slow-moving items.
- `Stock Availability Distribution`: Visualizes the percentage of in-stock products across the board, highlighting overall availability and service level.
